Task 7 - Create a banner 
Here we were tasked to create a p5.js banner to promote the course.
I decided to create an interactive landscape.

- This includes a Day/Night feature when the mouse is pressed on the canvas.

- The Sun rotates and randomly yet smoothly oscilated via the perlin noise function.

- The clouds are generated using a random shade, size, and horozontal speed value.

- The Mountains change shade when the time cycle is activated 

- When the mouse is pressed the sun moves below the canvas adn the moon moves into position
from above the canvas. 

- the smooth sun and moon motion is carried out using the lerp function 

- The stars originate from a random point on the canvas and using the lerp function, 
they move towards a point point which eventually spells out "creative coding"

- The letter coordinates were assigned useing the "pointsOf()" function.

- the size of the stars is set to a random value to simulate flickering.

- if the space bar is pressed, the stars will move back to they're original position.
