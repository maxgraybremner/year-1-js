Task 5 Part A - create a Sol LeWitt panel with 6 different panels, horozontal lines in the background 
and verticle line within the shapes.

The verticle lines within the circle are calculated by using basic trigonomentry 
a^2 = c^2 - b^2 

"a" is the distance from the centreline on the circle to the point on the circumference of the circle

"c" is the radius of the circle

"b" is the x distance from the beginning of the centreline to he line intersect.


The verticle lines within the trianges and other angled shapes were calculated by 

first finding the theta angle of the triangle
theta = atan((x/y)

then find the length of the y line depending on the x distance
y = tan(theta)
